Here's something that has changed how I understand most of my conflicts with people: the brain does not accurately report the cause of its own emotional states. It feels something, and then it generates an explanation. But the explanation is almost always wrong, or at best, incomplete. And you have no idea this is happening because the explanation arrives with full confidence.

## The speed mismatch

The core issue is timing. An emotional reaction, shame, anger, fear, happens in milliseconds. It's somatic. It's pre-verbal. By the time your conscious mind catches up and asks "why do I feel this way?", the raw feeling has already been processed, packaged, and rewritten into a narrative.

So you're never actually introspecting on the feeling itself. You're introspecting on a story your brain already constructed about the feeling. And that story has a predictable bias: it points outward.

Someone says something that triggers a deep sense of unworthiness in you. What you consciously experience isn't "I feel unworthy." It's "that person is disrespectful." Your brain performed a substitution. It swapped an uncomfortable internal truth for a more manageable external judgment. And it did it so fast you didn't notice.

## Why the substitution always points outward

This isn't random. Internal explanations ("I feel ashamed," "I'm afraid of being inadequate") are threatening. They require vulnerability and they don't come with a clear action. What do you do with "I feel unworthy"? It's just pain with no obvious target.

External explanations ("they're being rude," "this situation is unfair") are comfortable. They give you a target. They give you something to do: push back, argue, withdraw, judge. The brain prefers explanations that lead to action over explanations that lead to sitting with discomfort.

This is why, if you ask someone why they're upset, they will almost always describe the situation and other people's behavior. Rarely will they describe their own internal state. Not because they're being dishonest. Because their brain genuinely presented the external story as the real cause.

## The cost

The practical cost of this is enormous and mostly invisible. Think about how many arguments are actually two people reacting to their own unexamined feelings and then blaming each other for them. Person A feels insecure, interprets the other's behavior as dismissive, and gets angry. Person B feels controlled, interprets the anger as aggression, and shuts down. Both are responding to stories their brains generated, not to what's actually happening between them.

Most interpersonal conflict isn't a disagreement about reality. It's two people's confabulation engines clashing.

And it compounds over time. If you repeatedly act on misattributed emotions, you build a distorted model of your relationships and yourself. You start believing "people are generally dismissive" when the actual pattern is "I feel unworthy and interpret neutral behavior as rejection." Those are very different problems with very different solutions.

## What changes when you see this

The move isn't to distrust every feeling. It's to build a habit of pausing between the feeling and the story. When something lands hard, ask: what is the actual sensation right now? Not the narrative, not the judgment, just the physical reality of what's happening in your body. Tightness, heat, contraction, hollowness.

That raw layer is where the real information is. And it's usually simpler and less dramatic than the story. It's often something old. Something that has nothing to do with the person in front of you, who merely triggered a pattern that was already there.

Meditation is useful here not because it gives you answers, but because it trains you to notice the gap between feeling and story. With practice, that gap widens from nonexistent to a fraction of a second. That fraction of a second is the difference between reacting to a confabulation and responding to what's actually happening.
