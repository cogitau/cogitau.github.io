This is the first post on my new site. I built it with Next.js, Tailwind, and plain Markdown because I wanted something minimal that I fully control.

## Why a personal site?

I wanted a quiet corner of the internet to collect my writing, share projects, and reflect on practice.

## What to expect

- **Blog posts** on software, tools, and ideas
- **Journal entries** from meditation and contemplative practice
- **Projects** I'm working on or contributing to

More soon.
