When you really want something, your attention collapses around it. A job, a person, a specific outcome. Everything else fades. That one thing becomes the most important thing in the world.

On the surface, that feels productive. It feels focused. But it's actually making you fragile.

## The contraction

Craving contracts the mind. It zooms in. The object of desire fills your entire field of awareness, and the rest of the world dims. You stop noticing things. You lose perspective. Your sense of well-being starts balancing on a single point.

And then if that one thing wobbles, you wobble. If the person doesn't text back, if the interview goes sideways, if the project falls apart, it feels catastrophic. Not because the situation is actually that bad, but because you've narrowed your world down to the point where nothing else exists.

That's what I mean by fragile. A zoomed-in mind has no shock absorption. There's no wider context to catch you.

## The flashlight metaphor

Imagine your mind is a dark room.

Craving is a flashlight you're frantically waving around, searching for threats or treasure. The beam is shaky, narrow, desperate. And because you're so locked on finding the thing (or avoiding the thing), the darkness itself starts to feel threatening. You start believing the room is dangerous, that something is missing, that you need to find it right now or you're not okay.

That's what craving does. It doesn't just focus your attention. It distorts your relationship to everything outside the beam.

Samadhi (concentration meditation) is also a form of narrowing. But the quality is completely different. You're holding the flashlight perfectly still on one spot on the floor. Not because you want something from that spot. Not because you're afraid of what's in the shadows. Just because you chose to.

Because the beam is steady, you stop worrying about the rest of the room. You're not scanning for threats. You're not hunting for rewards. You're just still. And from that stillness, the room stops feeling threatening.

## The distinction

Craving-focus says "I need this thing to be okay." Trained attention says "I can pay attention to this without needing anything from it."

One reinforces the belief that you're incomplete. The other quietly breaks the link between focus and desire. You're teaching your brain that it can zoom in without grasping.

This shows up everywhere. Think about how you scroll social media. You're not looking for anything specific. You're just grasping. Each scroll is a micro-craving, and the more you do it, the more contracted and restless your mind becomes. Compare that to reading a book for an hour. Similar amount of focus, completely different quality of attention.

Or think about relationships. When you're obsessed with someone, your mind narrows around them. Every text matters too much. Every silence is loaded. You lose yourself. But when you genuinely love someone without that desperate grip, you can pay close attention to them and still be whole.

## Widening back out

The antidote isn't to stop caring or to stop focusing. It's to notice when your focus has that grasping quality, that contracted, tight, "I need this" feeling, and to practice the other kind. The steady kind. The kind where you're fully present but not clingy.

A mind that can zoom in without getting stuck is a resilient mind. A mind that zooms in because it's craving is one bad day away from falling apart.

The moments where I feel most anxious are almost always moments where I've collapsed my attention around one thing and convinced myself it's everything. The practice is noticing that, and gently widening back out.
