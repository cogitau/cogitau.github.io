Sat this morning for thirty minutes. The mind settled after about ten.

There's a quality of stillness that isn't the absence of thought but the absence of resistance to thought. Thoughts arise and pass like sounds in a room — noticed, not chased.

Today I noticed how much of my mental activity is rehearsal: planning conversations, replaying decisions. When I stopped engaging with the rehearsals, what remained was simple awareness of breath, body, light through the window.

Nothing profound. Just quiet. That's enough.
