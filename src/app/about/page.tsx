          Software engineer at LinkedIn, mostly thinking about how people find
          and connect with opportunity. Before that, a lot of time spent

          Away from a screen I gravitate toward contemplative practice, good
          sound systems, and making rooms feel like somewhere you&apos;d want to
          stay. These interests overlap more than you&apos;d think.
